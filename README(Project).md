AI WEATHER FORECASTER

This project is an AI-powered voice assistant that provides real-time current weather updates and a 5-day forecast for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
Built in Python, it leverages speech recognition and text-to-speech to enable natural voice interaction, and uses Matplotlib and Pandas for weather visualization.

🚀 Features
🗣️ Voice interaction: Speak to get weather information.
🌦️ Current weather updates with temperature, humidity, wind, sunrise/sunset, and more.
📈 5-day forecast visualization including average, min, max temperature, humidity, and rain chance.
🔊 Text-to-speech responses for a hands-free experience.
📊 Data visualization using matplotlib.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
speech_recognition
pyttsx3 (TTS engine)
requests
matplotlib, pandas
OpenWeatherMap API

💡 How It Works
Run the script.
The assistant greets you and waits for voice commands like "current", "forecast", or "exit".
It prompts for a city name via voice and fetches relevant weather data.
The data is spoken back to the user and displayed graphically (for forecasts).
